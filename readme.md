# Fahrenheit 735

## Dashboard for the Maverick 735 BT Thermometer

### Rationale
The official app is rather buggy and boring. The primary functionality that I missed was a times series graph of
probe temperatures. Having an e-smoker diary is a big plus as well.

### Backlog
* Turn these items into GH issues ;)
* Notify via webapp on signal loss
* Prettify
* Export cooks/"events" (public sharing)
* Integrate photos
* Abstract out & finish notifications (SMS/email/other?)
* Responsive for mobile
* Integrate with blower?
* More fields for smoker diary
* Arduino/raspbi/ESP8622 data collector
* Typescript?
* Testing?
